## Who is this for? üë©‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíª
People who just want to classify some audio quickly, without having to dive into the world of audio analysis.
If you need something a little more involved.

### Requirements
* __Python 3__
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* librosa
* NumPy
* Soundfile
* tqdm
* matplotlib

## Quick start
```python
from pyaudioclassification import feature_extraction, train, predict
features, labels = feature_extraction(<data_path>)
model = train(features, labels)
pred = predict(model, <data_path>)
```

Or, if you're feeling reckless, you could just string them together like so:
```python
pred = predict(train(feature_extraction(<training_data_path>)), <prediction_data_path>)
```

A full example with saving, loading & some dummy data can be found [here](https://github.com/puneetkakkar/audio-classification/blob/master/example/test.py).
